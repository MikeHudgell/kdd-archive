## Image Featurization

In this notebook we demonstrate featurization on a set of images. A pre-trained DNN image classification model is used to generate features for a set of images, which are then used to train a custom classifier. This is the simplest form of transfer learning, where the values leading into the last layer of the network are used as features, and we do not use backpropagation on the original DNN model. We use [MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark) Python library, for an easy and scalable image featurization. MMLSpark comes with a set of pre-trained neural networks that can be used for featurization. In this exercise, we use a pre-trained ResNet-50 deep neural network.

These images are from the [University of Oulu](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~olli/Projects/Lumber.Grading.html), Finland. The [labelled images](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/imag/knots/KNOTS) were saved as individual knot images by the original authors, and we segmented the "unlabelled" images by hand using [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg). We have converted all of the individual knot images to PNG format, and you can download zip files containing PNG versions of the [labelled images](https://isvdemostorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/wood-knots/labelled_knot_images_png.zip) and the [segmented unlabelled images](https://isvdemostorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/wood-knots/unlabelled_cropped_png.zip) from Azure blob storage.
